Accessibility statement for the NELCA PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system

This accessibility statement explains how accessible the PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system is, what to do if you have difficulty using it and how to report accessibility problems with the service.


## Using this service

The PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system is run by the North East London Commissioning Alliance (NELCA). We want as many people as possible to be able to use the system.

The PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system is a responsive web application. Which means you can use the built-in accessibility settings of your computer or mobile browser.

We've made the text in the PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system as simple as possible to understand. Technical language is used in line with the purpose of the system.

If you have a disability, [AbilityNet has advice to help you make your device easier to use](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/).


## Accessibility level of the PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system

This service is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

We know some parts of this website may not be fully accessible:

*   This system was developed as a rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
*   The system is built using the [NHS.UK frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) design system, which provides a good starting point for accessibility. However, the design system cannot cover all aspects of accessibility.
*   It has not been possible to do a formal accessibility assessment of this system in the time available, so please do get in touch if you have any issues using it or submit a pull request with suggested fixes

### What to do if you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/), or the [Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI)](https://www.equalityni.org/Home) if you live in Northern Ireland.


## Technical information about the PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system accessibility

NELCA is committed to making the PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

The PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system is a responsive web application and it is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), due to the limitations of time available to respond during the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Non-accessible content

[NHS.UK frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) design system has been used to build this system. Whilst this provides a baseline of accessibility in technical terms, it cannot cover all aspects of accessibility. 

Some content in the system may therefore be difficult to access for some users. It has not bees possible to arrange a formal assessment of this system, however we are keen not to exclude anyone and are committed to work with anyone who finds it difficult to use the system to ensure any barriers are removed.


## How we tested the PPE Inventory Stock Tracking system

This system has not currently undergone formal accessibility testing, however best efforts have been made to ensure that it is inclusive. NELCA are committed to ensuring that all users are able to work with this system.
